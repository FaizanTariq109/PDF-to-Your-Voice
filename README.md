# ðŸŽµ Text-to-Speech Generator (GTTS + XTTS)

This project is a **Text-to-Speech (TTS) generator** that can convert a PDF book (or any text) into speech.  
It provides two modes:

1. **GTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)** â€“ default robotic voice.  
2. **XTTS (Coqui TTS)** â€“ AI-powered voice cloning using your own sample voice.  

Built with **Streamlit** for easy interaction.
